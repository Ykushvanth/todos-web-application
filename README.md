# todos-web-application
This set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates a responsive to-do list web application. The HTML defines the structure of the page, including input fields, buttons, and the to-do list itself.
CSS styles the elements for a clean and visually pleasing interface, while JavaScript provides the functionality to add, delete, and update todo items dynamically. The application also utilizes local storage to persist todo items between sessions, ensuring a seamless userÂ experience.
